# Tree Starter

## Local Dev Proxy

Run the Vite dev server through a stable localhost hostname:

```sh
npm run dev:proxy
```

This runs `scripts/devsite.sh`, which:

- derives a hostname from the project folder, for example `tree-starter.localhost`
- assigns a stable port from the project path
- writes a Caddy route under `~/.local/share/devsite/routes/`
- starts or reloads Caddy
- runs Vite on `127.0.0.1:<stable-port>` with `--strictPort`

Open the printed URL, usually:

```txt
http://tree-starter.localhost
```

To override the hostname slug:

```sh
npm run dev:proxy -- my-name
```

Caddy must be installed and available on `PATH`.
